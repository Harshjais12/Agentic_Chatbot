# Daily AI News Summary

<think>
Alright, I need to tackle this query where the user wants AI news articles summarized in a specific markdown format. Let me break down the requirements to make sure I cover everything.

First, the user provided a set of articles with their content, URLs, and dates. My task is to process each article, extract the necessary information, and format it correctly. The output should include the date in YYYY-MM-DD format in IST timezone, a concise summary, sorted by date with the latest first, and each summary linked to the source URL.

I should start by parsing each article's date and converting it to IST. Since the provided dates are in different formats and time zones, I'll need to handle the conversion accurately. For example, the date "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 00:29:40 GMT" needs to be converted to IST, which is +5:30 hours. So, adding 5 hours and 30 minutes would make it September 8, 2025, in IST.

Next, I'll craft a concise summary for each article. Each summary should capture the main point without being too lengthy. I'll need to ensure that each summary is a sentence or two and is followed by the source URL in parentheses.

After summarizing all the articles, I need to sort them by date, with the most recent appearing first. I'll check each date, convert them if necessary, and then arrange them accordingly.

I also need to be careful with the formatting. Each date should be a level 3 header (###), followed by a list item with the summary linked to the URL. I'll ensure that the URLs are correctly formatted as hyperlinks in markdown.

Looking at the content, some articles might have similar dates, so I'll group them under the same date header if they fall on the same day. For instance, if multiple articles are from September 8, 2025, they'll all be listed under that date.

I should also verify that all URLs are correctly linked and that the summaries are accurate and concise. It's important to maintain consistency in the formatting to make the output clean and easy to read.

Finally, I'll review the entire output to ensure that all requirements are met: correct date formatting, concise summaries, proper sorting, and accurate links. This way, the user gets a well-organized and informative summary of the AI news articles as requested.
